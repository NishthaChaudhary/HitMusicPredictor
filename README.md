# HitMusicPredictor
NextGen Music system will predict how popular a new song will be. We are trying to investigate how old songs can be used to predict the popularity of the new songs based on the features of the song and their past popularity on old songs from 1991-2018. We will focus on few points like certain characteristics for hit songs and does the new song fall under this hit criteria. It can help a music company to decide the features/genre of the new music album so that it has high chances of success. What is used in analyzing data: KNN, Regression Analysis, Random Forest, Bayesian Logistic and Linear Regression.
